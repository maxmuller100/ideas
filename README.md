Project Ideas for The Social Code
=============================

In this document, we are working to create a list of projects we could work on as a group. This is mainly a source of inspiration, not a set of guidelines or specific projects that you have to work on. Everyone is more than welcome to add any projects that they can come up with, simply by editing this document (or by using a Pull Request).

We can take inspiration from such sources as:

Tinder for Politics
------------------
We're planning to create an app which looks like Tinder, but instead of matching with other people, you match with political statements. By swiping left or right, you can denote whether you agree with a statement. This is inspired by http://www.voter.xyz/, which can be downloaded for [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/voter-matchmaking-for-politics/id933655920?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.voter.xyz).

Facebook Feed Comparison
------------------
We hope to create a website similar to http://graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed/, but focused on the Netherlands.

Discussing Opposing Views
------------------
It would be great if two people with opposing political views could be connected, so they can get to know each other and try to understand each other's views. This could be similar to what [hey.ai](http://hey.ai/) is doing, namely a Facebook Messenger chatbot to connect people. Or more like [Hi From The Other Side](https://www.hifromtheotherside.com/).

Analyzing Facebook Post Trustworthiness
------------------
Create a Facebook add-on that enables its users verify the veracity of every post in their feed. To accomplish this, every post ought to be indexed according to its trustworthiness. While this wasn't discussed in the group, my (Max Muller) idea is to attach a percentage to indicate how trustworthy each post is. So 0% would be "utterly false: nothing in this post is true" and 100% would be "completely true: everything in this post is correct". There are some things that should be discussed, though. For instance: who is going to determine the veracity of all of the posts? Do we need experts to judge this? And what if two experts have different opinions on the veracity of a particular item? Perhaps, in this case, we could indicate a range of veracity. So if expert A says the article is 65% true, and expert B says the article is 80% true, then we could say: this article is 65% - 80% true. Another thing to keep in mind is that, on the other hand, many people have become wary of the so-called "experts". Especially when they can anonymously pass judgements on the veracity of certain articles. Therefore, I think we ought to discuss whether we should name the people who judged the veracity of the articles. If we allow this add-on to be more transparent, this project could be viewed as having more integrity. 

Highlighting Political Bias of Articles
------------------
Creat a Facebook add-on that allows people to see what the political "colour" or background of an article is. For instance, if an article is written by someone from the SP party and he or she incorporates socialist ideas within the article, the add-on could indicate that the colour of the article is red. If it's written by someone from the VVD who weaves liberal ideas with the facts and opinions stated in the article, the article becomes blue. Again, perhaps it's a good idea to add gradation. An article is probably never wholly red or blue, but somewhere in between. We could choose between all the shades of the spectrum of colours from red to blue. Perhaps this can also be done with a percentage. Again, the question of integrity and veracity of the people who judged the article as being red or blue or somewhere in between pops up. Do we mention the people who judged it as such? Do we mention why he or she judged it as such? Do we write a little story to motivate their decision? I think these are things we should talk about.
